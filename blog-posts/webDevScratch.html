			<p>Heading into college, I had little to no coding experience. As such, when I got to UW as a non-native,
				everybody congratulated and respected me for getting into the CS program from out of state. I felt like
				a fraud, an imposter amongst geniuses that were coding in assembly since birth. All around at the start
				of the year my peers seemed to surpass me and achieve things like internships their freshman year. With
				what little I had to my name, I decided to create a website and learn basics such as HTML, CSS, and
				JavaScript to create something tangible that I liked looking at. I had no idea what I was getting into.
				Circa Jan. 2025, my first draft of my website was born. </p>
			<img src="../assets/blog/first-draft.png" alt="Screenshot of the first draft of Chris' personal website">
			<p>Granted, it wasn't the best website to ever exist, but it was something I made by myself over winter
				break with the help of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://www.htmldog.com/">htmldog</a>. Coming back from fall (quarter system is weird) break I
				decided to focus on building a website that I could be proud of and learn from. Enter my short-lived
				Figma and graphic design phase. </p>
			<img src="../assets/blog/websiteProduct.png" alt="Screenshot of the final draft of Chris' personal website">
			<p>This was certainly an improvement, and I decided to implement it for my first ever personal website and
				taste of the web development and coding world. After about half a year I’m now here writing my first
				blog post about that journey. To say it was tedious was an understatement. My code as it stands is not
				something I’m the proudest because I now have learned so much from coding this that I can build it
				better with my new-found knowledge. However, I think it’s important to know that perfection doesn’t
				exist and that optimization and chasing goals endlessly leads to sadness, so I’ve decided to launch this
				website! I’ve learned so many things through this website and other projects and clubs such as how to
				make a website more accessible, better ways to style and animate elements, and how important it is to
				add documentation for the sake of maintaining code. I’m proud of my growth this past year, and I plan to
				code a lot more because I found it a very fulfilling experience! Making everything from scratch from my
				own custom logo to a very limited stack (Again, just pure HTML, CSS, and JS, no libraries or frame works
				DO NOT DO THIS!!!) gives me ownership over both the good and bad of this website! In the future I plan
				on focusing on more technical interests in cybersecurity, specifically web, app, and cloud security.
				Thank you for reading this and hopefully this website doesn’t brick itself! (I’ll try posting more about
				security or other cool things in the future!)
				<br>
				<br> With love, Chris. (っ˘ڡ˘ς)
